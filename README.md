## Install

Install **NodeJS** to get `npm` then follow.

```
$ npm install -g bower
$ npm install -g lite-server
$ bower install bootstrap -f --save
```

We had problems with de dependency tree, namely *bootstrap's* `bower.json`
requires *JQuery* at `jquery#1.9.1 - 2` and bower can't find this version.

## Running

```
$ lite-server
```

## Tests

The software requirements files are in the `test` folder, the final work should
resemble the validation images.
